            The tournament, held in late October ,
            is one of the four annual “Grand Slam” tennis events—along with the Santa Clara Open,
            San Luis Obispo Class, Ojai Open and Lake Tahoe Invitation and is the only one still played on natural grass.
            The first SCTC championship was held in 1927 on one of the grass lawns
            of the All Santa Clara Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club (since 1872 the All California Lawn Tennis
            Club).

        <p>

            The categories as last year were chicken, ribs, brisket and pulled pork in that order. Each entry in each category is judged for appearance, taste and tenderness.
             There were six teams competing, a manageable number in terms of how much you can taste and keep track of. (You are not supposed to directly compare one prep against another,
              but it’s good to have a reference range.)  Two of the teams were obviously more experienced and were probably neck and neck on most scorecards. 
            One team was aggressive with heat and smoke and broke a few SCTC rules but also scored points for taste and tenderness. 
            The others were newer to the game but I hope they’ll be back because this was an enjoyable and educational experience for us all.

          "Superb gastro-pub experience  While feasting, we were keen to visit the Wild Boar again. 
          We remember being impressed then and, if anything, they have improved! We arrived early to take in some mulled wine (delicious), 
          and then settled for the mushroom starter to share, followed by espatada"
